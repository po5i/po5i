Software development enthusiast. I am constantly learning and growing. I love supporting and building communities.

My main roles had been related to software development and consultancy, cloud deployment and infrastructure, project management with agile methodologies, Marketing, entrepreneurship, and growth.

Outside the programming world, I'm an amateur [photographer](instagram.com/po5i/) and martial artist.
